# HaveNotReddit

You may not be aware but Reddit only allows you to save a thousand posts before the oldest saved post gets removed from your "saved" list.  

In addition to this, you are not able to filter through your saved posts.  

So how can we fix this?  

Enter HaveNotReddit...

View, filter, and even download your saved posts!
